This is notably higher than the 1.7% difference observed in the older generation (over 40 years old). Therefore, the absolute difference in the share of adult men and adult women earning college degrees has gotten greater over time (The absolute difference has increased). Based on this, I conclude that the disparity between adult men and women obtaining college degrees has widened over time.\n",
                "> + From the table, it seems that in the younger generation today (in the age group under 40), adult women are more likely to have a college degree than men; while in the older generation (in the age group above 40), men are slightly more likely to have a college degree than women. \n",
                "> + This shift demonstrates a significant change in educational attainment trends between genders. It may due to the societal changes that prioritize and support women's education. For instance, in the old generation, women are more expected to stay in the traditional household instead of going to the workforce, so there's less incentives for women to get a college degree in the old times; However, in the young generation, women are encouraged to puruse higher education and enter the workforce to be independent like men do. Therefore, the widened difference in the share of adult men and adult women earning college degree implies an increased accessibility to higher education for women. \n",
                "> + In essence, while the older generation had a modest male advantage in college attainment, the tables have turned in recent times with women leading in educational attainment among the younger population. This trend signifies a crucial societal shift in the value and accessibility of education for women."
