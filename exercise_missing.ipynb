As we'll discuss in later lessons, to get completely accurate estimates from the ACS we have to take into account how people were selected to be interviewed. But you get pretty good estimates in most cases even without weights—your estimate of the racial wage gap without weights is within 5\\% of the corrected value. \n",

    "**Note:** This is actually an underestimate of the wage gap. The US Census treats Hispanic respondents as a sub-category of \"White.\" While all ethnic distinctions are socially constructed, and so on some level these distinctions are all deeply problematic, this coding is inconsistent with what most Americans think of when they hear the term \"White,\" a term *most* Americans think of as a category that is mutually exclusive of being Hispanic or Latino (categories which are also usually conflated in American popular discussion). With that in mind, most researchers working with US Census data split \"White\" into \"White, Hispanic\" and \"White, Non-Hispanic\" using `race` *and* `hispan`. But for the moment, just identify \"White\" respondents using the value in `race`.\n",

This shows that the disparity is even more pronounced when we exclude individuals identified as Hispanic and others.\n",

As a result, the observed income gap between the generalized White population and Black Americans appears to be smaller.\n",
    "  > - On the other hand, when we focus our analysis on just the \"non-Hispanic White\" subgroup, we are potentially looking at a population with a higher average income. Consequently, the income disparity between this subgroup and Black Americans appears larger."
